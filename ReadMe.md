# Finacial Calculator in JavaScript

I used the functtional and object oriented programming approach to solve the problem.

## Problem Description

Everytime I get paid I find myself doing the same routine of the following:

- Check how much I got paid
- Check my fixed expenses
- Find the difference between the two
- Divide that differeneces and add them the my didn't savings account

Now these task aren't difficult, but they are repetative. I want to write a function that will help me to solve the problem. So I did, and seeing that I'm learning JavaScript, I decided to use the object oriented approach and functional programming approach to solve the problem.
